Preparation of those 1,2-trans 2-O-glycosylated glycosides usually relies on 2-O-acyl participation requiring the selective installation and cleavage of 2-O-acyl groups. A convergent synthesis using 2-O-glycosylated oligosaccharide donors would be more straightforward but also pose greater challenges. Herein, we report a convergent synthesis of a distinctive tetrasaccharide isolated from starfish Asterias rollestoni Bell. Dual 2-(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl (DPPA) groups at O3 and O4 on galactose moiety led to high \\u03b2-selectivities (\\u03b2/\\u03b1=12/1 or \\u03b2 only) in the challenging [2+2] glycosylation, giving the desired tetrasaccharides in >90\\u2009% yields from the 2-O-glycosylated disaccharide donors. These synthetic studies have also unambiguously revised the structure of these natural tetrasaccharides. This work would facilitate further studies on new inhibitors of \\u03b1-glucosidase as hypoglycemic drugs.\\n\\nfile_path: ./documents/35921931.txt\\nid: 9aa47539-49e9-484d-bc5d-1f65ee0958fd\\npmid: 35921931\\njournal: 3.

Saponin, which possesses notable biological and pharmacological properties, is a key determinant of the nutritional and health value of A. japonicus. In the present study, we amplified the full-length cDNA of a phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) gene (named AjPMK) using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Subsequently, we engineered a recombinant AjPMK (rAjPMK) protein and assessed its enzymatic activity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Proteins that interact with rAjPMK were screened and identified via pull-down assay combined with liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We found that the full-length cDNA of AjPMK contained 1354 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 612 bp. The AjPMK protein was predicted not to contain a signal peptide but to contain a phosphonolate kinase domain seen in higher eukaryotes and a P-loop with a relatively conserved nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase domain. The molecular weight of the AjPMK protein was estimated to be 23.81\\u00a0kDa, and its isoelectric point was predicted to be 8.72. Phylogenetic analysis showed that AjPMK had a closer evolutionary relationship with genes from starfish than with those of other selected species. Besides, we found that rAjPMK synthesized mevalonate-5-diphosphate, interacted either directly or indirectly with crucial pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and was regulated by immune-related processes, including antioxidative reactions, stress resistance responses and enzyme hydrolysis. Moreover, AjPMK also interacted with farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, an enzyme reported to be involved in saponin biosynthesis. Together, our findings implied that AjPMK may be directly involved in saponin biosynthesis and the regulation of various innate immune processes.\\n\\nfile_path: ./documents/35383396.txt\\nid: d734d083-3881-437a-9958-5fe738612d37\\npmid: 35383396\\njournal: 4.

The rigid cyclic scaffold and the congested and vulnerable steroid-sugar etherate linkage present an unprecedented synthetic challenge. Here we report a collective total synthesis of the major starfish cyclic steroid glycosides, namely luzonicosides\\u2005A (1) and D (2) and sepositoside\\u2005A (3), with an innovative approach, which entails a de novo construction of the ether-linked hexopyranosyl units, use of olefinic pyranoses as sugar precursors, and a decisive ring-closing glycosylation under the mild gold(I)-catalyzed conditions.\\n\\nfile_path: ./documents/39387871.txt\\nid: 79c6be57-fe7e-411d-a5f2-bf5da9d2f4d8\\npmid: 39387871\\njournal: 4.

There is a resurgence of interest in those saponins produced by marine organisms based on their potential therapeutic benefits, application in food products and most recently their potential involvement in intra- and inter-species chemical communication. The continual advancements in liquid chromatography techniques and mass spectrometry technologies have allowed for greater detection rates, as well as improved isolation and elucidation of saponins. These factors have significantly contributed to the expansion in the catalogue of known saponin structures isolated from marine invertebrates; however, there currently exists no specific chemical library resource to accelerate the discovery process. In this study, a Marine Animal Saponin Database (MASD v1.0) has been developed to serve as a valuable chemical repository for known marine saponin-related data, including chemical formula, molecular mass and biological origin of nearly 1000 secondary metabolites associated with saponins produced by marine invertebrates. We demonstrate its application with an exemplar asteroid extract (Acanthaster cf. solaris, also known as crown-of-thorns starfish; COTS), identifying saponins from the MASD v1.0 that have been previously reported from COTS, as well as 21 saponins isolated from multiple other related asteroid species. This database will help facilitate future research endeavours, aiding researchers in exploring the vast chemical diversity of saponins produced by marine organisms and providing ecological insights, and the realisation of their potential for various applications, including as pharmaceuticals.\\n\\nfile_path: ./documents/39572855.txt\\nid: bb41dc31-f5f6-4a95-a2ed-3bbbcaab68f9\\npmid: 39572855\\njournal: 3.

Recent research suggests that starfish secondary metabolites possess antifouling and antifeedant properties and play a role in biological interactions and various ecological functions. Previous research demonstrated that saponins from starfish exert their toxic effects on fish by interacting with cholesterol in the blood cell membrane. This study investigated the hypothesis that secondary metabolites, other than saponins, from the starfish Asterias amurensis may be harmful to fish eggs, particularly marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) eggs, which share starfish habitat. We systematically separated the secondary metabolites of A. amurensis by a variety of chromatographic methods. Two oligoglycosides related to embryonic teratogenicity were identified, including one previously undescribed tetrasaccharide (1) and one known pyrrole oligoglycoside (2). Their structures were established mainly on the basis of detailed analysis of the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectroscopic data. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited strong lethality and significantly reduced voluntary movements in medaka embryos, with compound 2 showing more pronounced effects on teratogenicity and heart rates. The main morphological abnormalities observed included delayed head development (DHD), tiny spines (TS), incomplete absorption of oil balls (OB), cardiac abnormalities (CA), and shrunken yolk sacs (SYS). Our findings imply that starfish secondary metabolites may have broader ecological effects, influencing habitat-sharing species in subtle but crucial ways.\\n\\n        **Query:**\\n        What is the relationship of Starfish saponins?\\n        \"\r\n}",
